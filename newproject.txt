We're gonna make a new website

this website is gonna be like a store or informational site

it's gonna have a home page

and it's gonna have some options

what are we gonna do?

Maybe we can have some kind of movie things?

Screw it let's just do a generic web page

A blog maybe?

Just something that has pictures and graphs and the usual shit

some collapsible menus and side contents

let's just make and html page, something super basic at first
